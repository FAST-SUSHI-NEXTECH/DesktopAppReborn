DesktopApp for administror or more !
The DesktopApp work with electron
You need to install node.js to run electron

To see and run the whole work you can just clone all the repo and then in the terminal you have 2 command to do : 
npm init -y (you can let the default settings)
npm i --save-dev electron

The first command generate a file "package.json" where you have all your dependencies and the npm script. By the way add in the file "package.json" to run the framework 
    "start": "electron .",

The second one create the folder "node_modules"
And then you can run everything with "npm start", the default id is "Test" and the password is "1" . 

If you use VsCODE you will probably need some extensions to run everything
